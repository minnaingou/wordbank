## About This Project

WordBank is not just another dictionary app. So what is it?

Have you ever come across an unfamiliar word and looked it up in a dictionary, only to forget it a few moments later?

WordBank is an app to help you with that. With WordBank, you can lookup a word and save it to your favourite list along with the example usages and your own notes.
You can easily review them later in the Practice session where you will be presented with flashcards created from your favourites.

WordBank helps you memorize new words by prioritizing the words you just added, or the words you are having a hard time remembering before those which are more frequently reviewed, and are remembered well.
